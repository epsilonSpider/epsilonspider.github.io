## It's a lot of money

What's the risk curve look like for trading your mental health for money?

If there's a 50% chance that your mental health will deteriorate so much that you change as a person and hate your new self, how long can you put up with it before you are forced to leave anyway?  Would you take the gamble for **the chance** at earning $100k? $1M?

I reasoned it was worth it.  I already hated what my job had become but ~$400k was dangled in front of me with what I thought was a high chance of it paying off in 6-12 months.

The actual terms were that vesting would occur over 4 years.  But I suspected an acquisition or public offering was imminent.  And I was right.  6 months later the company would go public.

But I failed to understand the terms.  And the result was that I couldn't actually get that cash.  There were some convoluted legal entities created that meant I'd have to wait another 6 months.

## The result

It didn't payoff in the end.  I lost my "self" in the end.  I hated thinking back to how I felt, how I behaved, how I was spending my time, how I was acting, and how I was feeling.  I felt betrayed because of how I had sacrificed myself.

## Mistake #1

Working hard now for **promises** of future benefits.  If it isn't spelled out in a contract, it doesn't exist.

## Mistake #2

I actually thought the company was overvalued but expected the pay-off to be closer to ~$100k with a shorter timeline of ~6 months.

But sunk cost fallacy got me.  *Maybe just 6 more months.  I can do it.*

## Would I do it again?

If ~$400k had actually paid off after 6 months, I think it would have been a great deal.  It would have let me take a year off to recuperate and I'd be better off.  But I should have set hard deadlines.  I kept investing more and more time, gambling more and more.  And trading more of my mental health for what was a less likely big payoff.
